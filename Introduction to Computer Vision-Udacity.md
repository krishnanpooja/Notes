## Lesson 14- Camera and Images

#### Pinhole cameras:
A small hole allows only the required rays of light to pass. This captures the image in upside down. The size of the hole called the aperture.Ideal size is found to be 0.35mm. Larger the hole the image gets blurry. Smaller than 0.35mm causes diffraction which makes the image blurry again.

#### Thin lens:
Parallel rays meet at the focal point. The distance between the image and object to the lens, is computed using similar triangles.

Thin lens's eqn: 
z': distance of image film from lens
z: distance of the obj from lens
f: focal length
1/z'+z/z=1/f

#### Depth of Field:
Wide open aperture if you want to seperate foregound from background
Landscape aperture required is small. Everything in focus

#### Field of View (FOV)
- How wide is the view?
- Increase focal length of the lens, causes the zooming effect.
- Tripod is required for a stable picture. Less the image is going to shaky. 
- Longer the focal length==smaller field of view.


## Lession 15 - Perspective Imaging

#### Coordinate System
Right handed coordinate system. Assuming img plane is placed such that the img is not inverted. 
Projection Eqn:
Use similar Triangles
(X,Y,Z) -> (-d(X/Z), -d(Y/Z),-d)
Divide by Z, shows the obj farther away is smaller
Zero is the centre of the image
Causes: The moon to move with you, North star always in the North and the Sun's postion telling the time of the day

#### Homo Coordinates
Converting from homo coord:
[x y w]T => (x/w,y/w)

Perspective Projection: 
Multiply the img mat with the homo coordinates. This results the linear representation of the points.
