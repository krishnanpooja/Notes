## Lesson 14- Camera and Images

#### Pinhole cameras:
A small hole allows only the required rays of light to pass. This captures the image in upside down. The size of the hole called the aperture.Ideal size is found to be 0.35mm. Larger the hole the image gets blurry. Smaller than 0.35mm causes diffraction which makes the image blurry again.
